Learning Journal Day 8.
Hearing about the .includes method was neat. I was using .indexOf which was more complicated. It has been a fun challenge trying to figure out how to solve the problems given.  I feel like I have been going in the right direction with my thought process I am just missing the knowledge needed so that I can complete the problems without assistance.
