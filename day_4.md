## for Tyler Walser

Yesterday was interesting working with somebody else. I think it might have been better to work with somebody that was at a similar level to myself. although it did highlight how things can go once I am able have a better comprehension of all things Java.

I am looking forward to the weekend where I can try to catch up and feel less underwater with everything we have flown through this first week.
