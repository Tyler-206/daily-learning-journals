Learning Journal Day 3.

3st day of class went well. Although we weren't able to finish on task on the pair programming assignment. I also did not hit all the mvps on my portfolio assignment. Looking forward to the weekend to try and catch up.

Its really stupid we have to waste our time going to a meetup as an assignment. I am already leaving my house at 7 in the morning and I don't get home till after 8.
I left my job and have no income but I still have a mortgage and a family. So it is not only a time hardship but a monetary hardship (bus fare or parking) to do an additional commute into town on the weekend for a meetup I don't want to go to. Stupid.
